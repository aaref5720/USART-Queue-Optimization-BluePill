# USART Driver Optimization with Queue

This project aims to optimize the Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (USART) driver for the Blue Pill development board based on the STM32 microcontroller. The optimization is achieved by implementing a queue data structure to efficiently manage data transmission and reception.

## Overview

USART communication is crucial for many embedded systems, facilitating serial communication with peripheral devices, sensors, and other microcontrollers. However, traditional USART implementations often suffer from inefficiencies, especially in handling asynchronous data transmission and reception.

To address these inefficiencies, this project leverages a queue data structure. Queues are first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structures that enable efficient management of data, ensuring that data is processed in the order it was received. By integrating a queue into the USART driver, we can optimize data transmission and reception, leading to improved system performance and reliability.
